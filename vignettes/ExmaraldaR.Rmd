This package was developed to import transcripts of spoken language created with EXMARALDA (ADD CITATION) into R in a comfortable and fast way. First there will be some comments on how EXMARaLDA works and how transcription and annotation must be formatted to be easily readable. As I try to include more ways of transcribing and annotating data into this package, please write to me if your style does not work yet (timo.schuermann@uni-muenster.de).  

## Transcribing and annotating in EXMARaLDA

EXMARaLDA is a software package developed and maintained by Thomas Schmidt. Besides the transcription and annotation tool Partitur Editor, it includes a tool for managing corpora(Corpus-Manager) and a tool for searching and analysing (EXAKT). This package only contains a interface between R and the .exb format of the Partitur Editor. Maybe there will be options for segmetented files (.exs). Partitur Editor saves transcritions as an xml-based data format, which makes it possible to extract all relevant informations into a data table.
As this is can not be an extensive introduction in the EXMARaLDA-Software package i will in the forthgoing assume that the users of this package know:

1. how to create a transcription
2. how allign audio/video data and transcrition
3. how to transcribe 
4. how to annotate a transcription (including allinging)

In the following I will consider some features of the work process that lead to a well formed R- object. I will therefore go backwards, showing you the output of example files and then the parameter in the Partitur Editor leading to this specific output.

```{r}
read_exb_file(path= system.file("extdata", "Example_basic.exb", package = "ExmaraldaR", mustWork = TRUE), readAnn = FALSE, addMetaData = TRUE)
```
